We provide 2 options to run our code.
Since the code development is mostly done on Google Colab, it's recommeded to check our implementation in Accelearting_faster_rcnn.ipynb
If you are more comfortable with pure python, you can also clone our repo and follow the directions below to train your model:
1. run wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar to get the train and validation dataset
2. run wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar to get the test dataset
3. untar the 2 files
4. run python3 train.py to train the model
